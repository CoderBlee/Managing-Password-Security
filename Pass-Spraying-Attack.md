## Performing Password Spraying Attack

This project focuses on managing password security by demonstrating a password spraying attack and emphasizing best practices for securing network shares. The goal is to explore the vulnerabilities of weak or common passwords in a networked environment and to highlight the importance of using strong, complex passwords to safeguard sensitive resources. Through the use of tools like Hydra and basic Linux commands, this project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding password-related security risks and reinforcing effective password management strategies.
